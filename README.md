Readly
======

If writing is your bread and butter, Readly will be your jam. Readly is a clean typographic blog layout for writers who want to focus on their content. Showcase great images, clever quotes, and well-written posts without any distractions. Classic, simple, and subtle, Readly will allow your words and images to shine.

Readly will look great if you use lots of big, beautiful images. Upload a header image via the customizer, and featured images will appear in the header area for each individual post. Recommended sizes are 1600x475, but Readly will also look particularly good with a single full-page image, particularly for posts.

Readly uses larger images in galleries. To ensure you get the best possible experience, it's best to regenerate your thumbnails to ensure you're using good-sized images. Regenerate thumbnails is an easy plugin that will allow you to do this.

Readly will support either Infinite Scroll, or a footer area for widgets. You can choose which you'd prefer.

If you have social media links you'd like to include in the footer, add them using a custom menu. Support is automatically included for the following networks: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, Stumbleupon, Reddit, Flickr, Instagram, LinkedIn, Dribbble, Pinterest, Vimeo, and Youtube. You can easily add support for other networks, but you'll want to do some manual tweaking of the CSS in order to use custom icons and colours. Additional networks will appear with a simple star icon and will appear in a darker grey on mouseover otherwise.

Readly will support a long menu, but it's happiest if you use shorter menus. For best results, stick to five or six top-level items, and group other links under sub-menus.
